# Big OMG

Big OMG is a React application that analyzes the time complexity of user-inputted code. It aims to help developers optimize their algorithms by providing insights into the performance of their code.

It uses OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model to generate the time complexity of the code. The model is able to generalize to unseen code snippets and provide accurate time complexity information.

This is the frontend of the application only. It relies on a backend found here:
